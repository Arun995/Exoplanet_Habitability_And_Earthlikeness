# Planet Habitability and Earth Likeness Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict the habitability and earth likeness of exoplanets based on various input features using machine learning models. The goal is to provide insights into whether an exoplanet might be capable of supporting life and how similar it is to Earth.

## Features

- **Habitability Prediction:** Estimate the potential for an exoplanet to support life.
- **Earth Likeness Prediction:** Evaluate how similar an exoplanet is to Earth based on various characteristics.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Programming language used for developing the models and web application.
- **Flask:** Web framework for creating the web application.
- **scikit-learn:** Library for machine learning models (Random Forest Regressor).
- **Bootstrap:** Frontend framework for styling the web pages.
- **HTML/CSS:** For building and styling the web interface.

## Installation

- **Clone the Repository:**

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/planet-habitability-prediction.git
